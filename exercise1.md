In relation to the question of deploy the project in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment, my sense is that for a team of 6 people the project ,in relative terms , should not be too big and the option of cloud environment wold make more sense. Even though , if the are special features in the code (it' s a game with tons of graphics) the self-hosted option would be put first.
