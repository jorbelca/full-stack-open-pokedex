The continuity of the deployments has to be achieved with tools that give security, the options that I choose are: for linting, eslint, for testing cypress or jest depending the type and for building docker and ansible. The election is based on the widely use of the tools by the community and that the project is written is javascript. 
Other alternatives wold be influenced by the language or most important by the service that hosts the project, for example Azure has a complete pipeline including repos, test and the production environment.This is a cloud service, that is correct for the size of the project. 
In the case that the project includes different technologies a useful tool may be TeamCity. This service not has only compatibility with the 3 most widely used operating systems, also has support for BBD(solaris, redis,..) and web.
  
In relation to the question of deploy the project in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment, my sense is that for a team of 6 people the project ,in relative terms , should not be too big and the option of cloud environment wold make more sense. Even though , if the are special features in the code (it' s a game with tons of graphics) the self-hosted option would be put first.
